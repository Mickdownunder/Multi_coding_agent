# Initial Plan — Genesis

## Phase 1: Repository Initialization
1. Initialize a Git repository
2. Create a basic README explaining the system purpose
3. Ensure `/control` directory exists and is tracked by Git

## Phase 2: Project Skeleton
4. Initialize a minimal Node.js + Next.js project (App Router)
5. Configure the project to run locally via `npm run dev`
6. Add a basic page confirming the app is running

## Phase 3: Control Integration
7. Ensure the application can read files from `/control`
8. Display current system state from `state.txt`
9. Display contents of control markdown files

## Phase 4: Safety & Cleanliness
10. Ensure no unused files are generated
11. Ensure the project builds and runs without errors
12. Commit all changes with clear commit messages

## Exit Criteria
- The repository runs locally
- Control files are readable by the app
- No further planning is required for this phase
